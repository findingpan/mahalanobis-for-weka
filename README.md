Mahalanobis for Weka
========================

An implementation of the Mahalanobis distance metrics suitable for integration in Weka.

Can operate on matrices with feature values or Weka instances.

You will need the Weka 3.6 jar.

Sample output


 A = 
[2.0, 2.0]
[2.0, 5.0]
[6.0, 5.0]
[7.0, 3.0]
[4.0, 7.0]
[6.0, 4.0]
[5.0, 3.0]
[4.0, 6.0]
[2.0, 5.0]
[1.0, 3.0]



 B = 
[6.0, 5.0]
[7.0, 4.0]
[8.0, 7.0]
[5.0, 6.0]
[5.0, 4.0]


Mahalanobis distance between matrices A nd B is 1.410
